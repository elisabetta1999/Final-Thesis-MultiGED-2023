# Final-Thesis-MultiGED-2023
This repository contains all the notebooks used to align the development set of English (FCE and REALEC) and Italian of the MultiGED 2023 shared task to the original FCE, REALEC and MERLIN datasets in order to extract error types and corrections. This process is necessary to analyse in further detail the error types where my fine-tuned models fail more often in identifying incorrect tokens. The pre-processing notebooks can be found in 'pre-processing-notebooks'.

The notebooks used to fine tune and generate predictions on the test set are stored in 'fine-tuning-notebooks'. The notebooks to generate predictions on the aligned development sets are stored in 'evaluating-aligned-dev-notebooks'. The fine tuned models can be found here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1hujDAaKXmQoFQKJtkMPQ_wq1NAMABcrz?usp=drive_link.

The notebooks used to extract quantitative information for my error analysis and to generate corrections through QWEN can be found in 'error_analysis_stats_and_generating_corrections'.
